  <h2>Places to Visit</h2>
  <h3>Historical Center</h3>
  <p> Alstadt, Zurich's historical center is a beautiful mix of old and new. It's home to iconic churches like the twin towers of Grossmunster as well as Fraumunster, which is famous for its stained glass windows. You can also climb up Lindenhof Hill for a bird's eye view of the town and walk the pedestrianized streets of Niederdorf and Limmatquai—they are lively with shops by day and packed with nightlife as the sun goes down. </p>

  <h3 id="Lake Oeschinen Loop"> Lake Oeschinen Loop</h3>
  <p>This circular route to this breathtakingly beautiful mountain lake begins at the mountain station of the Oeschinensee gondola lift, which begins in Kandersteg. It is fed by the glacial streams of the Blüemlisalphorn, Oeschinenhorn, Fründenhorn and Doldenhorn.There are also a few mountain huts along the route, where hikers can recharge their batteries and really take in the Oeschinen area.</p>
